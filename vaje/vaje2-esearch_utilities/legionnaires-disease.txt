A pneumonia outbreak occurred during the 58th Annual Convention of the American 
Legion held in Philadelphia in 1976; in 1977, Legionella pneumophila was 
identified as the cause, and L pneumophila pneumonia was coined Legionnaires 
disease. The aquatic L pneumophila was aerosolized from the water in the air 
conditioning system and inhaled by the convention goers. Affected patients 
developed syndromes ranging from a flu-like illness to multisystem organ 
failure; 29 of the affected 182 patients died. Legionnaires disease is an 
atypical pneumonia frequently clinically different from other bacterial 
pneumonia. The predominant symptoms of Legionnaires disease include fever, 
cough, dyspnea, headache, and fatigue. The incubation period of L pneumophila 
ranges from 2 to 10 days following exposure to contaminated water. Radiographic 
findings of L pneumophila pneumonia will vary but are frequently described as 
patchy, fluffy, and unilobar infiltrates with a propensity to consolidate. 
Purulent sputum, pleuritic chest pain, and pleural effusion are less frequently 
encountered with L pneumophila pneumonia than other causes of bacterial 
pneumonia. Although Legionnaires disease may not differ from other types of 
community-acquired pneumonia, certain symptoms such as diarrhea and confusion 
increase the index of suspicion for legionellosis. Laboratory abnormalities such 
as hyponatremia, evidence of acute kidney injury, and elevations of 
transaminases, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, or C-reactive protein may be 
indicative of legionellosis. The diagnosis of legionellosis is based on clinical 
features, laboratory tests, and imaging studies. Treatment of Legionnaires 
disease comprises antibiotics effective against intracellular bacteria such as 
fluoroquinolones, macrolides, or tetracyclines. Legionnaires disease remains a 
critical public health concern due to its potential for outbreaks, high 
mortality rates in untreated cases, and the challenges associated with diagnosis 
and control. A comprehensive analysis of the genomic architecture and virulence 
determinants of L pneumophila illuminates the intricate mechanisms underlying 
its ability to establish intracellular infections within alveolar 
macrophages. Ongoing research seeks to elucidate the complex interactions 
between legionellae, their environmental niches, and human susceptibility 
factors, aiming to develop more effective preventive strategies and 
therapeutics. The prevention of Legionnaires disease requires proper maintenance 
and disinfection of water systems to reduce the risk of bacterial growth and 
exposure

PURPOSE/AIM OF THE STUDY: A case admitted with dysarthria and syncope and 
hyperintense lesion in the splenium of the corpus callosum, diagnosed as 
Legionnaires' disease by detecting Legionella antigen in the urine, and 
recovered only with antibiotic treatment is presented because it is rare in the 
literature.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: When a 64-year-old female patient was admitted to the 
emergency department with complaints of sudden loss of consciousness and 
fainting at home, she had speech impairment, and her pulse oxygen saturation in 
room air was 88%. In the neurological examination, there was no pathological 
finding except dysarthria in the patient with no motor deficit. The patient had 
no respiratory complaints and had a recent travel history. In laboratory 
examinations, hyponatremia was detected with increased C-reactive protein and 
liver enzymes. Consolidation was observed in the lower right zone on chest 
computed tomography. Ampicillin + sulbactam (4x1 gr, intravenous) and 
clarithromycin (2 × 500 mg orally) were initiated. On cranial magnetic 
resonance, a hyperintense lesion was observed in the splenium of the corpus 
callosum in the oval T2 sequence. Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 antigen in 
urine was reported as positive. On the fourth day of her hospitalization, the 
patient, whose CRP and liver enzyme values regressed, her hyponatremia improved, 
her pulse oxygen saturation increased to 92% in room air, and her speech became 
comprehensible, was discharged after oral antibiotic treatment was arranged. On 
the 12th day, the speech ability of the patient completely returned to normal.
CONCLUSION: Legionella infection should be suspected in the presence of 
pneumonia and corpus callosum splenium lesion.

Legionnaires' disease is a form of atypical pneumonia that can present with 
neurological symptoms, such as headaches, seizures, and focal neurological 
abnormalities. We report the case of a male patient who developed impaired 
consciousness and recurrent seizures following pneumonia caused by Legione lla. 
The patient received antibiotics and antiepileptic treatment and was discharged 
on hospital day 56. He was diagnosed with hippocampal sclerosis 10 months later. 
To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of hippocampal sclerosis 
following Legionnaires' disease globally. Clinicians should be aware of the risk 
of hippocampal sclerosis after Legionnaires' disease.

Legionnaires' disease (LD), caused by Legionella pneumophila, often presents 
with pneumonia, gastrointestinal symptoms, and confusion. Severe LD can lead to 
a triad of pneumonia, rhabdomyolysis, and acute kidney injury (AKI), with less 
common complications such as liver injury. We report a case of a 32-year-old 
male with no prior medical history who presented with LD complicated by severe 
rhabdomyolysis, AKI requiring hemodialysis (HD), and acute liver injury. The 
patient reported 6 days of gastrointestinal symptoms, reduced mobility, and 
minimal urine output. The patient also reported a history of vaping. Diagnostic 
imaging revealed pneumonia and enterocolitis, while laboratory findings included 
leukocytosis, hyponatremia, significantly elevated creatinine kinase 
(201 000 U/L), and acute transaminitis. A positive Legionella urine antigen 
confirmed the diagnosis. Initial treatment with azithromycin for 7 days showed 
partial improvement; however, clinical and laboratory deterioration necessitated 
a switch to levofloxacin for an additional 7 days. This case highlights rare, 
severe multi-organ involvement in LD, with rhabdomyolysis and AKI being 
particularly pronounced. The possible association between vaping and Legionella 
infection is explored, given the patient's history of vaping and limited prior 
documentation of such a link. Prompt recognition, accurate diagnosis, and 
escalation of therapy are critical in managing severe LD and reducing associated 
morbidity.

BACKGROUND: Legionnaires' disease has a high clinical mortality rate, and early 
diagnosis and treatment are critical. Increasing evidence shows that metagenomic 
next-generation sequencing (mNGS) has excellent potential for the early 
identification of pathogens. To help clinicians better recognize Legionnaires' 
disease in its early stage and to illustrate the diagnostic value of mNGS 
technology, we reviewed and summarized two cases of severe Legionnaires' 
disease.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We selected two patients with severe Legionnaires' disease 
who were admitted to our department in recent years. We discuss experience with 
them and the shortcomings in their treatment by summarizing their medical 
history, disease evolution, tests, and diagnostic and therapeutic processes.
RESULTS: In both patients, the diagnosis of Legionnaires' disease was confirmed 
through analysis of the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). The middle-aged 
male patient was cured and discharged due to early detection and diagnosis. The 
elderly immunocompromised patient died due to a delay in diagnosis.
CONCLUSION: This study highlights the importance of the early recognition and 
diagnosis of severe Legionnaires' disease and the advantages of mNGS in 
identifying the pathogen.
