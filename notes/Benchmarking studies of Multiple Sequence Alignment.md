*How can we asses the accuracy and performance  properties of the various [[Five main approaches to Multiple Sequence Alignment|described algorithms]]?* 

Performance depends on various factors

- num. of sequences being aligned
- their similarity
- num. of deletions/insertions
- ...

There are **databases** with information about [[Sekundarna struktura proteinov|protein secondary]] or [[Terciarna struktura proteinov|tertiary structure]] including distantly related proteins that are **known** to be [[Homologs|homologous]]. 

For these proteins, **structural data can be used** to decide the extent to which [[Introduction to Multiple Sequence Alignment|MSA]] programs are accurate.
